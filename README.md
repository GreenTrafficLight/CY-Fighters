# CY-Fighters

Project for school. (Had to do it 3 times, one time with the interface stored in array, second time with ANSI escape codes, third time with ncurses,  I didn't know I was allowed to use this library smh ![1x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76498277/172260306-3b2f75c8-181f-4145-bd5d-2cbf51e77ca5.png), the two first times wasted me a lot of time). Still may updating it despite being past the delay, oh well, it may be still worth it

# CY-Fighters

Project for school. (Had to do it 3 times, one time with the interface stored in array, second time with ANSI escape codes, third time with ncurses,  I didn't know I was allowed to use this library smh, the two first times wasted me a lot of time). Still may updating it despite being past the delay, oh well, it may be still worth it
